00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:35,567
Oh, yeah.  It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."

520
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:37,408

521
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:38,807
What dialect?

522
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,186
Wakanada...?  Wa, wa...Wakanda.

523
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:44,895
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
