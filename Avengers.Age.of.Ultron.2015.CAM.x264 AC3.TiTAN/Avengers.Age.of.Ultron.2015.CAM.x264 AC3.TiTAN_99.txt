475
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,270
three feet from our faces.

476
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:09,405
And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

477
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:10,709
Stark.

478
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:14,714
We were trapped two days.

479
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:21,895
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "this will set if off."
